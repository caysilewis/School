            <blockquote> "With my copious fortune, I plan to fund a school with a passion for education in the art that is food. I would like students to be able to experience the culture of other countries, simply from the food that they eat." -Caysi Lewis (founder)</blockquote>

            <h3>Who is Caysi?</h3>
            
          <p> Caysi Lewis was born in June of 1999. Throughout her lifetime she was legendary among her peers for her large appetite. She enjoyed eating family sized mozzerella sticks by herself, and taking advantage of sushi happy hour at the famous "Red Bowl." She lived to the ripe old age of 102 years old, having been alive through 3 different centuries. Legend has it that even into her hundreds, she was seen eating a whole pizza to herself. Cause of death was never determined but family friends say she died choking on a chicken bone wing. Being the philanthropist that she was, she decided to give her billion dollar fortune away to fuel her life long passion; food. </p>
